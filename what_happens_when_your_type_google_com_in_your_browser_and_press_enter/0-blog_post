# What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?

This post explains what happens behind the scenes when you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter. This is a common software engineering interview question that tests your understanding of networking, systems, and web technologies.

## 1. DNS Resolution

The first step is to resolve the domain name `www.google.com` to an IP address.

- The browser checks its cache.
- If not found, it asks the operating system.
- The OS checks its own cache.
- If still not found, a query is sent to the DNS resolver (usually your ISP's or a public DNS like Google’s 8.8.8.8).
- The resolver queries root DNS servers, then `.com` TLD servers, and finally Google’s authoritative DNS server.
- An IP address is returned (e.g., `142.250.72.14`).

## 2. TCP/IP Handshake

Now that we have the IP address, the browser initiates a TCP connection:

- A TCP 3-way handshake is initiated with the server on port **443** (used for HTTPS).
  - SYN → 
  - SYN-ACK ← 
  - ACK →

- This ensures a reliable connection between your device and Google’s server over the IP network.

## 3. Firewall Checks

As the packets travel, they pass through various firewalls:

- Your local machine firewall
- Your router’s firewall
- ISP-level firewalls
- Google’s data center firewalls

These firewalls may inspect, allow, or block traffic based on rules.

---

## 4. HTTPS and SSL/TLS

Before any real data is exchanged, the browser and the server perform a **TLS handshake**:

- The server sends its SSL certificate.
- The browser verifies it via Certificate Authorities (CAs).
- A symmetric session key is generated using asymmetric encryption.
- From now on, all communication is encrypted (HTTPS).

---

## 5. Load Balancer

Your request hits Google’s **load balancer**:

- Google uses DNS-based and hardware/software load balancers to distribute traffic.
- The load balancer routes your request to one of many backend servers closest to your location or least loaded.

---

## 6. Web Server

The load balancer forwards your request to a **web server** (e.g., Google’s custom servers or Nginx).

- The web server parses the request.
- It decides whether the response is static (like HTML/CSS) or dynamic.

---

## 7. Application Server

If dynamic content is needed:

- The web server forwards the request to an **application server**.
- The application server may be running code (e.g., written in C++, Go, or Python) to process the request, authenticate the user, etc.

---

## 8. Database Query

If the request requires data:

- The application server queries a **database** (e.g., Bigtable, Spanner).
- Data is retrieved and returned back up the chain:
  - From database → application server → web server → browser

---

## 9. Rendering the Page

Back in your browser:

- HTML is parsed and the DOM is built.
- CSS is applied.
- JS is executed.
- Additional resources are loaded (images, scripts, etc.).
- The final page is displayed to the user.

## Conclusion

Typing `https://www.google.com` triggers a complex series of events across many layers of the web stack: DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, encryption, load balancing, backend servers, and databases. Understanding this flow is essential for any software engineer working on web applications or infrastructure.
